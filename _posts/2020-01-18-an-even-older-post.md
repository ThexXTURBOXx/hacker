excerpt: A post to demonstrate the flexibility of the in-post navigation links.
hide_navigation: true
---

This post shows that the 'previous' link will only display if there is a previous post to go to.
The 'next' link is smart in a similar way, which you can see if you click through to the format demonstration post at the end.

It also demonstrates the ability to hide the full site navigation menu normally seen above. This can be achieved by adding

```yml
hide_navigation: true
```

to your post's front matter.
