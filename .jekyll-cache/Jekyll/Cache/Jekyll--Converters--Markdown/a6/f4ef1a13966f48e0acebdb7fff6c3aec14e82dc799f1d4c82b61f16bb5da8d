I"r<p>This post shows that the ‘previous’ link will only display if there is a previous post to go to.
The ‘next’ link is smart in a similar way, which you can see if you click through to the format demonstration post at the end.</p>

<p>It also demonstrates the ability to hide the full site navigation menu normally seen above. This can be achieved by adding</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">hide_navigation</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to your post’s front matter.</p>
